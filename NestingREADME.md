Glmu\_nesting\_data
-------------------

This dataset was randomly generated in excel and mirrors the format of the data I will collect in Spring 2019 during my thesis field season. I will be measuring depredation rates on artificially created turtle nests in order to measure the effects of urbanization on depredation rates from subsidized mesocarnivores.

I plan to use a regression framework to analyze my data, and am thinking of using logistic regression to compare proportions of nests depredated within wetlands to landscape-scale urbanization.
