## Week 1

This file is all about the lizards dataset I used for the first assignment. I need to figure out what dataset I am going to use for the rest of the class. But for this script I did all of the things we were supposed to do in the first assignment: do some basic manipulations, view and summarize the data, aggregate the data in a couple of different ways, and then create a table. The name of the script that I used was "week1".

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
